[Verse 1]
[Male]
The She-Wolf's attack has swept through the field
My banner is broken, my proud armies yield!
[Female]
The Kingmaker’s winter is finally done
I broke them at Wakefield, now here they all run!

[Pre-Chorus]
[Male]
My plans turn to ashes, my honour is stained
But the Son of York's victory is not yet contained!
[Female]
My sad king is rescued, my triumph is great
Now London will open its cowardly gate!

[Chorus]
The tide of the war can be turned in a day
One fool's hesitation throws kingdoms away
The gates of the city, the key to the crown
One army rises, one army goes down!

[Verse 2]
[Male]
I meet with young Edward, the Sun's holy light
He shows me a path to still win this whole fight!
[Female]
I send them my terms but the cowards delay
My hungry host sickens with every new day!

[Pre-Chorus]
[Male]
Forget the main army, the risk is too great
We'll ride for the city and seal England's fate!
[Female]
My victory spoils, my confidence sours
While I wait for their answer, they count down the hours!

[Chorus]
The tide of the war can be turned in a day
One fool's hesitation throws kingdoms away
The gates of the city, the key to the crown
One army rises, one army goes down!

[Verse 3]
[Male]
We ride like the devil, a blur of white and gold
The gates that were barred fly open, we're told!
[Female]
Too late I now see it, the trap has been laid
My perfect advantage, my victory betrayed!

[Bridge]
[Male]
We've taken the city, the prize is now won
The age of your Henry is over and done!
[Female]
This is not the ending, you've just won the start
I'll come back with armies and tear you apart!

[Chorus]
The tide of the war can be turned in a day
One fool's hesitation throws kingdoms away
The gates of the city, the key to the crown
One army rises, one army goes down!
