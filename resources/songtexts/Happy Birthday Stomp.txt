(Verse 1)
The landlord frowns, he wants his pay! (All shout: "Not tonight!") We'll settle up another day! The fire is warm, the ale is brown, The happiest rogue in this whole damn town Is sitting right here, so clear the floor! He's lived a year, he'll live one more!

(Chorus)
(Music goes double-time, very fast and raucous) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, MY FRIEND! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAY THE ALE NEVER END! (All shout: HEY! HEY! HEY!) THE LUTE IS FAST, THE JIG IS HERE, WE'LL TOAST YOUR HEALTH AND ONE MORE YEAR! ANOTHER WINTER'S BITE YOU'VE BEAT! SO DRINK IT DOWN AND STOMP YOUR FEET!

[hook]

(Verse 2)
The butcher's son is on the flute! (All shout: "He's terrible!") The tanner's daughter shakes her boot! There's mud and straw upon the planks, We're spinning 'round in drunken ranks! Forget the cold, forget the rain, It's time to fill the horn again!

(Chorus)
(Music goes double-time, very fast and raucous) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, MY FRIEND! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAY THE ALE NEVER END! (All shout: HEY! HEY! HEY!) THE LUTE IS FAST, THE JIG IS HERE, WE'LL TOAST YOUR HEALTH AND ONE MORE YEAR! ANOTHER WINTER'S BITE YOU'VE BEAT! SO DRINK IT DOWN AND STOMP YOUR FEET!

[hook]

(Bridge)
(Music gets heavy, stomp-and-clap section. Slower tempo.)

Some men have silver, some have land, (Stomp! Clap!) Some have a broadsword in their hand! (Stomp! Clap!) But what's the use of all that toil? (Stomp! Clap!) When you are laid beneath the soil! (Stomp! Clap!)

So we'll take tonight! (Shout: "TONIGHT!") And we'll take this ale! (Shout: "THIS ALE!") And we'll sing this song till we all turn pale! 

(Final Chorus)
(Music goes double-time, very fast and raucous) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, MY FRIEND! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAY THE ALE NEVER END! (All shout: HEY! HEY! HEY!) THE LUTE IS FAST, THE JIG IS HERE, WE'LL TOAST YOUR HEALTH AND ONE MORE YEAR! ANOTHER WINTER'S BITE YOU'VE BEAT! SO DRINK IT DOWN AND STOMP YOUR FEET!
