[Verse 1]
My northern host triumphs on Edgcote's red field
The father and brother of the new Queen must yield
I send them to judgment, a swift, final sword
The price has been paid, the balance restored
And in the confusion, with his army undone
I corner the lion, the great warrior son
The hero of Towton, the king in his prime
Is now just a prisoner, running out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
His crown has been humbled, his power is mine
I wait for the kingdom to fall into line
The pieces are set for the checkmate I crave
To rule from the shadows, a king as my slave

[Chorus]
This is the Kingmaker's gambit, a lesson in pride
Where the fate of a kingdom, two players decide
I pull on the strings of the web that I've shake
To see if the maker can break what he's made.

[Verse 2]
I summon a parliament, speak with his voice
But the lords of the kingdom deny me the choice
They send back my letters with cold, silent scorn
A kingdom unled is a kingdom stillborn
The power I seized is an illusion, I find
My orders are worthless, they leave me behind
The king is my puppet, but no one will bow
My greatest achievement is useless to me now

[Pre-Chorus]
His crown has been humbled, his power is mine
But the rest of the kingdom refuses the sign
The pieces are set, but the board is a mess
My triumph is turning to utter distress

[Chorus]
This is the Kingmaker's gambit, a lesson in pride
Where the fate of a kingdom, two players decide
I pull on the strings of the web that I've shake
To see if the maker can break what he's made.

[Bridge]
Now red roses bloom in the north once again
A Lancastrian banner, a new host of men
I'm trapped in this gambit, a checkmate I see
To fight this new threat, I must set the king free!
But the lion I freed has grown and sharp teeth!
He crushes my rebels with lightning fast speed 
He finds all my letters, now I have no friend.
With treason the Kingmakers tale must not end. 

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
This is the Kingmaker's gambit, a lesson in pride
Where the fate of a kingdom, two players decide
I pull on the strings of the web that I've shake
To see if the maker can break what he's made.

[Outro]
So I'll swallow my pride, let the irony sting
And kneel to the She-Wolf to take down a king
The bitterest poison, the unholiest bed
To stand with the Rose that I once painted red.
