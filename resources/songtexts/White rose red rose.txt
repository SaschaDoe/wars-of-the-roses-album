[Intro]
[Verse 1]
King Henry's mind has gone astray
While England crumbles day by day
We've lost our lands beyond the sea
No gold remains, we're not free
From Ireland sails the Duke of York
With royal blood to shame the court
But Queen and Somerset conspire
To keep him from his heart's desire
Storm clouds gather, thunder calls
Pride comes before the fall
Ancient blood will have its say
Tomorrow starts today
[Chorus]
White Rose, Red Rose, burning bright
Shadow falls on England's light
White Rose, Red Rose, heart of stone
Brother fights for brother's throne
[Verse 2]
The Queen from France with wolf-like eyes
Margaret guards her son's prize
She rules the court, she rules the king
While York grows strong, his allies sing
Somerset bleeds the kingdom dry
Suffered, stabbed, the people cry
The nobles choose which rose to wear
As on they march to Alban's Square
Storm clouds gather, thunder calls
Pride comes before the fall
Ancient blood will have its say
Tomorrow starts today
[Chorus]
White Rose, Red Rose, burning bright
Shadow falls on England's light
White Rose, Red Rose, heart of stone
Brother fights for brother's throne
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Dawn is breaking, steel will sing
Every lord must choose his king
At the gates of old Saint Alban's town
One rose rises, one goes down
[Chorus]
White Rose, Red Rose, burning bright
Shadow falls on England's light
White Rose, Red Rose, heart of stone
Brother fights for brother's throne
White Rose, Red Rose, England cries
Choose before the morning dies
Choose before the morning dies
