(Verse 1) The mud still clings to armour bright, a crimson stain beneath the moon Another battle fought tonight, another promise come too soon We left the fields of France behind, our banners torn, our coffers drained No foreign foe for us to find, just English blood, on English plains! The men I brought from Calais shore, hardened steel and battle-worn Now stand for York, and ask no more, than to see Lancaster forlorn. Oh, the spoils of war, once a king's command!

(Pre-Chorus) But something changed when we came home, the loyalties are rent and frayed No common cause, no distant foam, just ancient grudges, unafraid! The old alliances, bought with gold, now shattered by a brother's hate A prophecy, a story told, sealed by the hand of cruelest fate!

(Chorus) I AM THE KINGMAKER! MY HANDS ARE STAINED! WITH ENGLISH BLOOD, A CROWN PROFANED! NO RANSOM CALLED, NO GLORY WON! JUST NOBLE HOUSES, BENEATH THE SUN! FOR YORK OR LANCASTER, THE DIE IS CAST! THE FEUDAL ORDER, FADING FAST! A GRIM HARVEST, SOWN IN PRIDE! WHERE OLD ARISTOCRATS HAVE DIED!

(Verse 2) I stood at St. Albans, felt the sting, of turning blade and brother's plea Remember Crécy, hear the ring, of honour in captivity A captured lord, a ransom paid, a noble life could be redeemed But here, a different game is played, a nightmare I could not have dreamed. Young Somerset, I watched him fall, his head upon the block I laid No gentle word, no final call, his ancient line, a debt unmade. The axe falls swift, the claim is gone!

(Pre-Chorus) For power now, is all we crave, to crush the rival, end his claim One foot in battle, one in grave, fuelled by ambition's burning flame! The old alliances, bought with gold, now shattered by a brother's hate A prophecy, a story told, sealed by the hand of cruelest fate!

(Chorus) I AM THE KINGMAKER! MY HANDS ARE STAINED! WITH ENGLISH BLOOD, A CROWN PROFANED! NO RANSOM CALLED, NO GLORY WON! JUST NOBLE HOUSES, BENEATH THE SUN! FOR YORK OR LANCASTER, THE DIE IS CAST! THE FEUDAL ORDER, FADING FAST! A GRIM HARVEST, SOWN IN PRIDE! WHERE OLD ARISTOCRATS HAVE DIED!

(Guitar Solo – epic, soaring, but with an underlying melancholy)

(Bridge) I see the future, cold and bleak, beyond this endless, bloody war The ancient pillars, now so weak... what were we even fighting for? The Crown will stand, a thing of dread, no Baron left to stay its hand A tyrant ruling over dead, an iron fist across the land! Will chaos reign, the centre fall, when all the noble blood is gone? Or one dark King to rule us all? A lonely god upon a throne? The age of honour... bled away...

(Verse 3) But visions fade! The present calls! To see the house of Woodville fall! The Queen's own father, Rivers, proud, And his whelp John, who cried aloud. I dragged them from the field at Edgecote's fight! No jury, trial, or ancient rite! Just cold, hard steel upon the stone, I HEARD THE AXE SPLIT FLESH AND BONE! This is the price, to rule the day!

(Chorus) I AM THE KINGMAKER! MY HANDS ARE STAINED! WITH ENGLISH BLOOD, A CROWN PROFANED! NO RANSOM CALLED, NO GLORY WON! JUST NOBLE HOUSES, BENEATH THE SUN! FOR YORK OR LANCASTER, THE DIE IS CAST! THE FEUDAL ORDER, FADING FAST! A GRIM HARVEST, SOWN IN PRIDE! WHERE OLD ARISTOCRATS HAVE DIED!
