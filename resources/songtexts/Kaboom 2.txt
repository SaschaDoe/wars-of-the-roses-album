[Chorus]
Kaboom! Kaboom! The future of the fight!
My modern guns shall blast Edward from sight!
The Kingmaker commands when destiny shall bloom,
But first, my lords, we'll give them the kaboom!
[Verse]
Through the Easter morning darkness, my cannons stand in line,
With powder, shot, and confidence, victory be mine!
"These guns from FRANCE are wondrous, they'll make young Edward swoon!"
Load the bronze! Prepare to fire! We'll show them our kaboom!
[Verse]
All through the night we fired away to keep them from their sleep,
"Disturb their rest! Destroy their camps!" I told my gunners keen.
But in the dark we hit some cows, a barn, and our latrine...
The only thing we murdered was our own canteen!
[Verse]
The fog rolls in at Barnet field, I cannot see a thing,
But Warwick says "Just fire away! And make those cannons sing!"
We shoot into the murk and gloom, at Edward's men assume,
But all we hit is empty air... still, what a nice [break] kaboom!
[Chorus]
Kaboom! Kaboom! The future of the fight!
My modern guns shall blast Edward from sight!
The Kingmaker commands when destiny shall bloom,
But first, my lords, we'll give them the kaboom!

[Bridge]
[Spoken]
"My lord, we hear our guns hit naught but trees!"
"Just fire more! Bring them to their knees!"
"But sir, the fog! We cannot see! Our shots fly past their heads!"
"Fire louder! Make them flee!"
"Wait... whose banner's that —"
"Oh shit... "

[Chorus]
Kaboom! Kaboom! But not where we had planned!
Oxford's banner through the fog—mistaken by our hand!
Star and Streams looked like the Sun—we fired on our own!
My fancy guns caused panic with their worthless damn kaboom!
[Chorus]
Kaboom! Kaboom! The future of the fight!
My modern guns shall blast Edward from sight!
The Kingmaker commands when destiny shall bloom,
But first, my lords, we'll give them the kaboom!
[Outro]
[Spoken]
"That's IT! I'm going back to the damn longbows!"
