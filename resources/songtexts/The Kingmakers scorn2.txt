[Verse 1]
I stand for England in the halls of France
To seal the throne to end this bloody dance
The French king listens, to the boy I crowned
The Kingmaker's power greatest on foreigners ground

[Pre-Chorus]
But whispers arrive on a sour wind
A tale of a secret, a promise rescinded
The courtiers are laughing, they mock and they stare
At the fool who builds castles of dust in the air

[Chorus]
The fortress I built you is cracked at the stone
For a Lancastrian serpent you placed on the throne
The blood shed at Towton was wasted for this
You traded an empire for a commoner's kiss!

[Verse 2]
I come home to a court that I no longer know
A tide of new nobles where my seeds used to grow
They're given the titles, the lands, and the brides
While my family's fortune the new king divides

[Pre-Chorus]
I speak to my king of the dangers ahead
But the words of the Kingmaker fall on him dead
The boy I once mentored is blinded by lust
My counsel is broken, my loyalty crushed

[Chorus]
The fortress I built you is cracked at the stone
For a Lancastrian serpent you placed on the throne
The blood shed at Towton was wasted for this
You traded an empire for a commoner's kiss!

[Bridge]
I remember the blizzard on Towton's dark sod
The mountain of corpses now this man blieves he's god
A king is a man, and a man can be broken
The Kingmaker's final, [break] dark word [break] has been spoken.

[Hook]

[Chorus]
The fortress I built you is cracked at the stone
For a Lancastrian serpent you placed on the throne
The blood shed at Towton was wasted for this
You traded an empire for a commoner's kiss!
