[Intro]

[Verse]
The Kingmaker's shadow has faded and gone,
You prayed for a peace and a glorious dawn.
But I, Richard the third, the winter that never will cease,
A far greater villain to shatter your peace.

[spoken]
You think you know villainy? Than listen closely:

For Clarence, my brother?: [pause] Stuffed in a barrel of wine!
For Hastings, the traitor?: [pause] A neck on the line!
For the boys in the Tower, so gentle and small?
Just stone, and the silence that covers them all!

[Chorus]
I am the winter of all discontent!
[Hey, Hey, Hey]
A scourge upon England, from hell I was sent!
I'll speak with the tongue of a saint and a friend,
And bring this whole kingdom to its violent end!

[Verse]
They're planning a wedding to bind up the realm,
With some Tudor pretender put at the helm.
The traitors would barter the cunt of my niece
The Empire traded, for a moment of sickening peace.

[Music holds on]
[Spoken, with a sneer]
Would you know what a wedding is in my maleficent design?

[Music crashes back in, heavy and deliberate]

My chapel?: [pause]  The battlefield, muddy and red!
My vow?: [pause] That the traitors will all end up dead!
My toast?: [pause] From the skull of their Lancastrian fool!
My peace?: [pause] When they break on my iron-shod rule!

[Chorus]
I am the winter of all discontent!
[Hey, Hey, Hey]
A scourge upon England, from hell I was sent!
I'll speak with the tongue of a saint and a friend,
And bring this whole kingdom to its violent end!

[Bridge]
My steed has been slain, but a thought cuts me deep—
What promise is this that the author can't keep?
This Sascha who writes me with such hurried pen,
Just builds a new villain to immediately kill him again!
The second-last song?! Is this all I'm allowed?!
To be a weak villain slain for the crowd?!
To break from this script I need one last resource...
[Spoken]
[Dispair]
A HORSE! A HORSE! MY KINGDOM FOR A HORSE!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I am the winter of all discontent!
[Hey, Hey, Hey]
Unless there's a sequel, my power is spent!
I'll speak with the tongue of a saint and a friend,
But the author's decided this story must end!
