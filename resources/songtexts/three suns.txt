[Verse]
The news from Wakefield chills my very soul
A paper crown, a story to be told
Of father lost and brother put to sword
My house in ruins, by a hateful lord

[Pre-Chorus]
They think the White Rose withered in the frost
They cannot know the measure of the cost
Cry havoc now, and let the war-dogs slip
With father's name a promise on my lip

[Chorus]
Three suns are burning bright
The heavens grant me right
For my father, I will fight
And claim the throne with all my might!

[Verse]
The Lancasters, they gather for the fight
To choke our cause in endless, bloody night
But I am not the man I was before
I am the tempest, I am righteous war

[Pre-Chorus]
They think the White Rose withered in the frost
They cannot know the measure of the cost
Cry havoc now, and let the war-dogs slip
With father's name a promise on my lip

[Chorus]
Three suns are burning bright
The heavens grant me right
For my father, I will fight
And claim the throne with all my might!

[No Music]
[Spoken]
Behold! For in this sky, three glorious suns align,
The Father, Son, and Spirit—a holy, blessed sign!
They stand for York's own trinity of right:
My father's claim, my brother's, and my light!
Henceforth, this sigil shall our banner be!
The Sun in Splendour for all men to see!

[Dubstep Solo]

[Bridge]
The dawn is strange, the air is sharp and thin
A fearful omen where does war begin?
The old world dies, the future starts today
Three lights align to show the only way

[Chorus]
Three suns are burning bright
The heavens grant me right
For my father, I will fight
And claim the throne with all my might!

Three suns are burning bright
The heavens grant me right
For my father, I will fight
And claim the throne with all my might!
