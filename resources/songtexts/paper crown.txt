[Verse 1]
The walls of Sandal are my shield of stone
I hold the right to England's holy throne
The She-Wolf's army gathers on the field
But to my royal blood, her force must yield

[Pre-Chorus]
The war-horn screams a note of victory
I ride them down for all the world to see
But see the hills, the banners start to rise
A sea of steel beneath the winter skies

[Chorus]
It's not the grand design that wins the bloody game
It's who can feed the chaos, fan the burning flame
The wisest plan is dust before the turning tide
But a crown is still a crown, when everything has died

[Verse 2]
The trap is sprung, my men are cut apart
A foolish pride has stabbed me through the heart
My standard falls, my noble cause is lost
I learn the true and final, bitter cost
I'm pulled from horse, surrounded by the foe
The seeds of arrogance are what I sow
My final breath is stolen by a blade
For one mistake, the highest price is paid

[Pre-Chorus]
My war-horn screams a note of agony
This frozen field, the end of all I see
The hills descend, the banners blot the rise
The light now fades before my dying eyes

[Chorus]
It's not the grand design that wins the bloody game
It's who can feed the chaos, fan the burning flame
The wisest plan is dust before the turning tide
But a crown is still a crown, when everything has died

[Bridge]
The fight is done, the silence rings so cold
My spirit lingers, a story to be told
I watch them raise my head upon a spike
A final jest, a tyrant's deep dislike
They laugh and cheer, my final, cruel reward
The last decree of my most hated lord
They fold the paper, press it to my brow
My coronation is happening right now

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
It's not the grand design that wins the bloody game
It's who can feed the chaos, fan the burning flame
The wisest plan is dust before the turning tide
But a crown is still a crown, when everything has died
But a crown is still a crown, a spark to light my son's eyes
