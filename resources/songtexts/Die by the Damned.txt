Die by the Damned
[Verse]
A king is acclaimed in the great city's hall
While north in the winter, the red banners call
Two households in conflict on one English ground
By civil division, no peace can be found
The die has been cast now, the armies will meet
To claim glorious victory or final defeat
On a field in the north, a kingdom to save
Or send a whole generation to an early grave

[Pre-Chorus]
So north rides the White Rose to answer the call
On one single battle, the kingdom will fall
The armies will meet where the cold blizzard blows
This is the day that all England now knows!

[Chorus]
Is this our fate, to bleed in the snow?
Where might makes right, and mercy won't grow?
The strongest will crown the king for today
But is brutal force the only right way?
Blood for the throne! Blood for the land!
Will England find glory or die by the damned?

[Verse]
The south wind is blowing, a gift for the White
It carries their arrows with merciless might
A black cloud of death in the snow-blinded air
The North shoots back blindly, their hope turns to despair
The Yorkists advance in the chaos and storm
To gather the arrows and keep their lines warm
They send back the volley, a grim, deadly art
And tear the Lancastrian vanguard apart

[Pre-Chorus]
The White Rose has answered the North's bitter call
This day in the blizzard, Lancaster falls!
The armies have met where the cold blizzard blows
This is the day that all England now knows!

[Chorus]
Is this our fate, to bleed in the snow?
Where might makes right, and mercy won't grow?
The strongest will crown the king for today
But is brutal force the only right way?
Blood for the throne! Blood for the land!
Will England find glory or die by the damned?

[Bridge]
Ten hours of carnage, a grim human wall
For every man standing, another must fall
The lines start to waver, a crack in the shield
Is this where the fate of the battle's revealed?
But look to the hillside, a banner appears!
Comes Norfolk's fresh power to banish their fears!
A hammer of steel on the flank of the foe
The Red Rose is broken, now reap what you sow!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
They choke the Cock Beck, turn its waters to red
And flee on a bridge that is built of the dead
O, woe to the land where a son in the fray
Hath killed his own father this sorrowful day
And woe to the land where a father must stand
And find his own son's blood upon his own hand
This is the great tragedy, England's deep scar
The true face of hatred in this civil war

[Chorus]
Is this our fate, to bleed in the snow?
Where might makes right, and mercy won't grow?
We've crowned a new king through the blood of our kin
But what kind of England will this slaughter bring in?
Blood for the throne! Blood for the land!
Will England find glory or die by the damned?
