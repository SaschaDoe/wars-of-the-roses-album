[Intro]
Hear the bells proclaim the day!
Hearts rejoice in grand array!
Raise your voices, kingdom wide,
For this groom and for this bride!

[Verse]
Behold the King, of noble soul,
Who makes a fractured kingdom whole.
And see the Queen, with sunlit grace,
Who finds at last her rightful place.

[Chorus]
REJOICE! LET HEAVEN'S ANTHEM RING!
FOR THIS NEW QUEEN AND THIS NEW KING!
A GOLDEN VOW THE STARS DECREED,
A TIMELESS LOVE, A SACRED CREED!

[Verse]
Within his gaze, her light does dwell,
And through her smile, he breaks the spell.
Two souls entwined, their journey starts,
The true-born rulers of our hearts.

[Chorus]
REJOICE! LET HEAVEN'S ANTHEM RING!
FOR THIS NEW QUEEN AND THIS NEW KING!
A GOLDEN VOW THE STARS DECREED,
A TIMELESS LOVE, A SACRED CREED!

[Verse]
She sees in him her safest shore,
He finds in her what he'd searched for.
Through whispered vows and tender tears,
They promise love through all their years.


[Bridge]
Lord Uncle stands with beer-filled cup,
His speech starts well, then hiccups up!
"To love!" he cries, then tumbles down,
The Queen can't help but laugh out loud!

[Chorus]
REJOICE! LET HEAVEN'S ANTHEM RING!
FOR THIS NEW QUEEN AND THIS NEW KING!
A GOLDEN VOW THE STARS DECREED,
A TIMELESS LOVE, A SACRED CREED!

[Outro]
FOR QUEEN AND KING, THE SONG RESOUNDS!
UPON THIS HALLOWED, BLESSED GROUND!
A LOVE ETERNAL, NOW IS CROWNED!
