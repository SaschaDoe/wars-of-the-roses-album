[Verse]
I watch you in the candlelight alone
A gentle king upon a brutal throne
Your fingers trace the scriptures, worn and old
While outside these walls, the world is cruel and cold
You speak of saints, you kneel and softly pray
To wash the blood of England's sins away
A king of peace, a scholar, and a friend
Whose gentle reign, this age will surely end.

[Pre-Chorus]
My father's house, the proud and cursed Anjou
Was born to fight in all that we pursue
I see that same dark shadow, long and vast
Upon your noble, fragile soul now cast.

[Chorus]
A curse on Anjou, a shadow so long
We strive for a world where we'll never belong
And you, my poor Henry, a soul far too kind
A winter lamb lost in the bitterest wind
You were not made for this merciless age
A quiet lament on a blood-spattered page.

[Verse]
Sometimes you leave me, though you're by my side
Your eyes are open, but your spirit hides
A waking dream, a place I cannot see
And all the weight of England falls on me
I wear the armour, and I draw the sword
To fight the battles of my pious lord
Another prince from Boccaccio's sad hall
Predestined to rise, and destined to fall.

[Pre-Chorus]
So I will be the storm, and I will be the shield,
And stand for you upon the bloody field.
While you find comfort in a holy creed,
I am the one who answers England's need.

[Chorus]
A curse on Anjou, a shadow so long
We strive for a world where we'll never belong
And you, my poor Henry, a soul far too kind
A winter lamb lost in the bitterest wind
You were not made for this merciless age
A quiet lament on a blood-spattered page.


[Bridge]
This is not his dream, for I see it take hold!
His grandfather's ghost, made of crystal and cold!
He speaks of our legacy, lost to the sword,
My beautiful son, my beloved, send to the lord!

From your peaceful soul England leans its true might, 
To build an empire where the sun never yields to endless night
A golden age of prosper the world has never seen,
And at its heart shall stand a Virgin Queen!


[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
A curse on Anjou, a shadow so long
We strive for a world where we'll never belong
And you, my poor Henry, a soul far too kind
A winter lamb lost in the bitterest wind
You were not made for this merciless age
A quiet lament on a blood-spattered page.

[Outro]
Here in this temple of our tragic fate...
Le Temple de Boccace...
Too late...
