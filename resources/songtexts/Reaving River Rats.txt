[Verse]
The lords all squabble and they feud
It puts us in a thieving mood!
While knights in steel are off to fight
And argue who is wrong or right,
They're much too busy on the shore
To hear us kicking in the door!
We're river rats with hooks and knives
Who live the very best of lives!

[Verse]
The "Kingmaker," that Warwick Earl,
Gives all his battle flags a twirl!
He calls his fleet a "privateer"
But he's our boss, the pioneer!
He says, "It's war!" with a sly wink
We say, "Let's go and steal a drink!"
He gets a cut of all our sin
As we bring all the plunder in!

[Pre-Chorus]
So hide your gold and hide your beer!
[whisper] The sneakiest pirates are right here!
The river's ours, from bank to bank!
Let's find a merchant ship to spank!

[Chorus]
WOAH! A VARLET IN LONDON'S TIDE!
WITH A STOLEN SHIP AND NOWHERE TO HIDE!
FOR THE RED ROSE OR THE WHITE, WE'LL CHEER
AS LONG AS WE CAN STEAL YOUR BEER!
WOAH! THE THAMES IS OUR BATTLEGROUND!
THE RICHEST TREASURE CAN BE FOUND!
WITH A WINK AND NOD AND A DIRTY PLOT
WE'RE Reaving River Rats, WE'LL TAKE THE LOT!

[Verse]
We saw a barge just packed with wine
Meant for some fancy lord to dine
We swung aboard with hooks and glee
And set the priceless cargo free!
The merchant wailed, "You thieving rats!"
We just tipped our smelly hats
His vintage now is on the breeze
Or sold for pennies and some cheese!

[Verse]
They'll hang you high down Wapping way
A lovely view across the bay!
At Execution Dock you'll sway
And dance until your dying day!
They leave you dangling for the tide
With nowhere left to run or hide!
But risk is why we love the game
At least they'll scream our bloody name!

[Spoken]
Like: Barnacle-Bottom Barry, Gavin the Gormless, First Mate 'Finicky' Fredrick Fiddlesticks
Or: Sir Francwilli Fancypants (the Third) 
And: Commodore 'Clumsy' Cuthbert Clutterbuck
Not to forget: Captain Spack Jarrow
And last but not least: Sir Reginald Stout-Belly of the Soggy Bottom Boys

[Chorus]
WOAH! A VARLET IN LONDON'S TIDE!
WITH A STOLEN SHIP AND NOWHERE TO HIDE!
FOR THE RED ROSE OR THE WHITE, WE'LL CHEER
AS LONG AS WE CAN STEAL YOUR BEER!
WOAH! THE THAMES IS OUR BATTLEGROUND!
THE RICHEST TREASURE CAN BE FOUND!
WITH A WINK AND NOD AND A DIRTY PLOT
WE'RE Reaving River Rats, WE'LL TAKE THE LOT!

[Accordion Solo]

[Bridge]
Some men will toil behind a plow
Or take a pointless battle-vow!
We'd rather live a life of glee
With stolen rum and anarchy!
The nobles taught us every crime
We just got better at it over time!

[Chorus]
WOAH! A VARLET IN LONDON'S TIDE!
WITH A STOLEN SHIP AND NOWHERE TO HIDE!
FOR THE RED ROSE OR THE WHITE, WE'LL CHEER
AS LONG AS WE CAN STEAL YOUR BEER!
WOAH! THE THAMES IS OUR BATTLEGROUND!
THE RICHEST TREASURE CAN BE FOUND!
WITH A WINK AND NOD AND A DIRTY PLOT
WE'RE Reaving River Rats, WE'LL TAKE THE LOT!

WE'LL TAKE THE LOT!
WE'LL TAKE ALOT OF LOT!
