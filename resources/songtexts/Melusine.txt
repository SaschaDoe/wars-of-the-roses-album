[Intro Verse]
You ask me, brother, how we fail? How Woodville’s line did breach the pale? How does this common, low-born ghost, Now rule our King and rule our host?
I blame the witch, Woodville's art, That poisoned noble Edward's heart! She holds my King with her thrall, With magic foul, to damn us all!

[Pre-Chorus]
You think this is new? This art is old. A story that must now be told. It flows in her... from Jacquetta's line, The ancient curse...

[Chorus] 
MELUSINE! The water's shriek! Her serpent's pact, the throne is weak! A fey-born magic from the deep, The ancient curse the blood will keep! MELUSINE!

[Verse]
A fountain in the forests deep, Where Poitou's grieving son did weep. He’d slain his lord, his hope was gone, 'Til she arose with the silver dawn.
A fey-born beauty, pledge and plea: "I’ll give you lands and dynasty, A castle built in one dark night..." He swore the oath, ensnared by sight!

[Pre-Chorus]
"But hear my law, my love, my life!" (She charmed him as a future wife...) "Upon the seventh day, the Sabbatum! You must not see what I've become!"

[Chorus]
MELUSINE! The water's shriek! Her serpent's pact, the throne is weak! A fey-born magic from the deep, The ancient curse the blood will keep! MELUSINE!

[Verse]
He took the pact, his power grew, A fortress rose from stone and dew. She gave him sons, the strange-eyed seed, But in his heart, a brother’s creed... "What demon bride have you embraced? What Sabboth rite has she defaced?"

[Pre-Chorus]
The seventh day, the oaken door! He hammers, screams, and breaks the law! He takes his sword, a fatal sin, To spy the darkness held within!

[Bridge]
He peers inside... no bride at all!
A woman’s face... a SERPENT'S TAIL!
She gives the shriek, the Cri de Fae!
A sound to steal a mortal's day!

[solo]

[Verse]
"That shriek, they say, still haunts the stone, A banshee wail for blood and throne. And Jacquetta, of that same line, Brings that old curse to Edward’s wine!
With leaden dolls and twisted charms, She pulls a weak king to her arms! It is no love! It is the art! The ancient poison in her heart!"

[Final Chorus]
MELUSINE! The water's shriek! Her serpent's pact, the throne is weak! A fey-born magic from the deep, The ancient curse the blood will keep!
MELUSINE! The water's shriek! Her serpent's pact, the throne is weak! A fey-born magic from the deep, The ancient curse the blood will keep! MELUSINE!
