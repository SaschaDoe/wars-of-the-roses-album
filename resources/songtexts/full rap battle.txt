Rap Battle of History
Margarate de Angou vs. [pause] THE KINGMAKER

[spoken]
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick  the name,
But they call me the KINGMAKER—I run this whole game!
Been crowning and dethroning since before you were born,
Made a king out of Eddie—now that oath has been torn.
FORM RANKS! What do I see? The She-Wolf of France, thinks she's Cersei,
Mother's love couldn't save either prince—both corpses, no mercy! 
Your husband's a joke, unfit for the throne,
"any place but hell"—said it. [pause] Full blown.
St. Albans? Just practice. Testing my skill,
While you sat in Paris, dressed to kill.
You're a painted queen, baby, your whole vibe is fake,
Trying to rule England? That's your mistake.
I'm the GOAT of this war, the master, the best,
Now step to the mic if you're ready to test.

[female]
They call me She-Wolf, French Bitch, Foreign Queen,
Call me Margarete, most savage royal you've ever seen—
Kingmaker? Please. You're a fair-weather friend,
Switching your colors depending on trend.
First you're with York, "Long live the King!"
Then you flip sides for the power it brings.
"If Warwick shakes his bells"—oui, we all know the line,
But bells without loyalty? That's a terrible sign.
You called me a wolf? Écoute? [pause] wolves lead the pack,
Better a wolf than a snake that stabs backs.
I crossed the whole Channel, raised armies from dust,
While you sat here scheming who next you could bust.
You think you're a player? Boy, you're just a pawn,
A footnote in history when I'm dead and gone.
You fight for your ego, your pride, and your name,
But I fight for mon sang—my blood—now that's a real game!

[spoken]
Your blood? You mean your dead Prince of Wales?
Tewkesbury sends regards—how'd that battle fails?
Heard he died begging. Run through. Done.
Guess mommy's protection couldn't save your son.
"A crown or a tomb!"—isn't that what you said?
Well, he got option B. Your boy's stone dead.
You mocked Richard's death with a paper crown scene,
But karma came calling, if you know what I mean.
ADVANCE! [pause] I orchestrate battles like a symphony grand,
Your strategies crumble like castles of sand.
Took your weak Henry. Locked him up in the Tower.
Your whole French alliance? Lost all its power.
I'm the architect here, the brain and the might,
You're just a "foul stigmatic" who can't win a fight!

[female]
Don't speak my son's name, you "abortive rooting hog!"
You left your own king lost in the fog!
You died at Barnet, face down in the mud,
The great Earl of Warwick, choking on blood.
Mais attendez—let's rewind to where your pride really broke,
Let's talk about Eddie and his ultimate joke.
You made him a king, your star, your best man,
But he played you completely—destroyed your whole plan!
While you were in France getting Anne for his queen,
He married a Woodville behind the whole scene!
Elizabeth cancelled you! Left you on read!
Your own puppet king wanted you dead!
He took all your power, your castles, your land,
The king that YOU made just bit your whole hand!


[spoken]
FIRE! My cannons' roar doth split the gate,
Thy doom approaches—'tis already too late!
My ordnance speaks thunder, my halberdiers advance,
You brought swords to a cannon fight—not a chance!

...Wait. Hold up. She's... she's spitting straight facts.
The king that I crowned pulled a Walder Frey on my back
I gave him the throne, the glory, the crown,
And that ungrateful boy tried to tear me down...
YO EDWARD! Yeah YOU in the royal box seat!
Sitting there smirking while we bring the heat!
You think you're untouchable? King of it all?
Boy, you're about to witness your fall!
Margaret, this beef? It's done. It's dead.
We got bigger fish—let's take Eddie's head!

[female
The She-Wolf and Kingmaker, united at last—

[male]
Eddie, your reign's ending, and it's ending FAST!

[female]
You married beneath you, disgraced your whole line,
Chose Woodville trash over Warwick's design!

[both]
You're soft! Getting fat while we bleed in the field,
More interested in women than wielding a shield!
So sit in your palace, enjoy your last feast,
'Cause the Wolf and the Kingmaker just became BEASTS!


Rap Fast commanding spoken bariton male vocals, like an opera voice, lead an epic choir. The music is driven by relentless, sharp staccato guitar riffs and fast double-bass drumming,

A fast rap battle with pounding martial war drums and epic orchestral stabs. The vocals are a deep, commanding, grunting baritone, full of aggression
