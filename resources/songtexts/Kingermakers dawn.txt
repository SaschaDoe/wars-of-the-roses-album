[Verse 1]
Through morning mist we march with righteous flame
Three thousand shadows 'neath the bear and chain
No golden circlet calls us—only shame
When Somerset's betrayal stains the reign
[Pre-Chorus]
They said the crown was kissed by heaven's light
Untouchable, ordained, beyond our sight
But when divinity tastes mortal blade
THE HEAVEN'S PROMISE DIES BETRAYED!
[Chorus]
Strike! Strike! We claim our right!
Strike! Strike! We've crossed the veil!
Where St Albans bleeds tonight
Tomorrow breaks the ancient scale!
When powder speaks, bloodlines grow quiet
The blade becomes tomorrow's scribe
Strike! Strike! Gods can bleed!
THE OLD WORLD DIES!
[Verse 2]
While dying men confess their hollow vows
The leopard banner mocks—but where's its king?
He trembles while his faithful take their bows
This isn't war—it's history taking wing!
[Pre-Chorus]
They said the crown was kissed by heaven's light
Untouchable, ordained, beyond our sight
But when divinity tastes mortal blade
THE HEAVEN'S PROMISE DIES BETRAYED!
[Chorus]
Strike! Strike! We claim our right!
Strike! Strike! We've crossed the veil!
Where St Albans bleeds tonight
Tomorrow breaks the ancient scale!
When powder speaks, bloodlines grow quiet
The blade becomes tomorrow's scribe
Strike! Strike! Gods can bleed!
THE OLD WORLD DIES!

[Guitare Solo]

[Bridge]
Through garden walls, through ancient stone
I lead them for a dream unknown
We take the heights, we own the sky
And rain our judgment from on high!
The streets become our forge of fate
The white rose blooms where red once reigned!
One final push rewrites the state—
The future's born from what we've slain!
[Final Verse]
The tanner's inn becomes a sacred stage
Where mortal flesh meets divine pretense
We've torn the veil between the coming age
And all that was—now nothing's as immense
[Pre-Chorus]
They said the crown was kissed by heaven's light
Untouchable, ordained, beyond our sight
But when divinity tastes mortal blade
THE HEAVEN'S PROMISE DIES BETRAYED!
[Finale Chorus]
Strike! Strike! We claim our right!
Strike! Strike! We've crossed the veil!
Where St Albans bleeds tonight
Tomorrow breaks the ancient scale!
When powder speaks, bloodlines grow quiet
The blade becomes tomorrow's scribe
Strike! Strike! Gods can bleed!
THE OLD WORLD DIES!
