[Verse 1] The city's held, the gates are mine The winter’s cold, the Yorkist sign! But steel and blood won't bend the knee They need a word from God, not me. A flock of sheep, they wait for grace A king by might is commonplace I have the sword, the brutal art But he... my brother... holds the heart.

[Pre-Chorus] He stands at Paul's, in robes of white A shepherd in the fading light! He speaks of sin, of Henry’s shame He calls on God's most holy name! "A broken oath! A crown betrayed!" The sermon for our crusade!

[Chorus] HEAR MY BROTHER'S VOICE! (Choir: DEUS VULT!) HE MAKES THE SACRED CHOICE! (Choir: SANCTUS!) HE TURNS THEIR HEARTS AS ONE, BENEATH THE YORKIST SUN!  THE WILL OF GOD... MY WILL IS DONE!

[Verse 2] The blood of Towton, washed by rain Now Westminster, we come again! The sacred stones, the ancient hall To raise our king before the fall. The scent of incense, thick and sweet The stones of kings beneath our feet He holds the oil, to make him pure A king's disease... a Neville's cure.

[Pre-Chorus] He holds the crown of shining gold The greatest story ever told! He speaks the oath, the mass is sung "Behold your king, the chosen one!"

[Chorus] SEE MY BROTHER'S HAND! (Choir: DEUS VULT!) HE SANCTIFIES THE LAND! (Choir: SANCTUS!) HE PLACED THE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD, THE OLD KING FLED!  THE WILL OF GOD... MY WILL IS DONE!

[Bridge] The incense smoke... it clouds their eyes. The holy water... sanctifies the lies. But in the crowd, some eyes are cold. They've learned the truth our actions told.

WE GAVE THEM KINGS, BUT KILLED THEIR GOD! THE VERY GROUND WE ONCE HAVE TROD! THIS FAITHFUL WORLD... IS FADING FAST... AND WE, THE CRAFTSMEN... ...WILL BE THE LAST!

(Guitar Solo)

[Chorus] HEAR MY BROTHER'S VOICE! (Choir: DEUS VULT!) HE MAKES THE SACRED CHOICE! (Choir: SANCTUS!) HE TURNS THEIR HEARTS AS ONE, BENEATH THE YORKIST SUN!  THE WILL OF GOD... MY WILL IS DONE!
