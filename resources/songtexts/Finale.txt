The Kingmakers Fall

[Verse]
The sun is clouded on this fateful morn
A final battle where a peace is sworn
In blood or victory, today we choose
The last great gamble that we cannot lose

[Pre-Chorus]
The cannons roar into the wall of white
Where friend and foe are stolen from our sight
The lines advance, a tide of unseen steel
To make the judgment of this day real!

[Chorus]
I am the Cedar, tearing flesh from bone!
I am the Kingmaker, crushing Yorkist throne!
My sword shall carve the fate of England's crown
That's the end, I'll burn this kingdom down!

[Verse]
A cry rings out, a panic and a fear
My own left flank is striking at my rear!
But through the fog, a brother's sun breaks through
Clarence, you traitor! Damnation shall take you!

[Pre-Chorus]
The tide has turned, the trap is closing fast
My final gambit was not meant to last
The hunters close, my banner starts to fall
I stand alone, prepared to lose it all

[Chorus]
I am the Cedar, tearing flesh from bone!
I am the Kingmaker, crushing Yorkist throne!
My sword shall carve the fate of England's crown
That's the end, I'll burn this kingdom down!

[Bridge]
Through the mist, the Sun in Splendor strides!
The golden prince for whom I turned the tides
"Old teacher, face the student you have made!"
His burning crown against my bloodied blade
My sword screams hunger for his royal throat
While traitor's blood still stains my battle coat!
No quarter asked, no mercy will be shown—
Now let us settle this with steel alone!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
His blade finds home between my armor's seams
And with my blood flow all my shattered dreams
The princely eagle whom I taught to fly
Has struck me down and left me here to die

[Hook]

[Verse]
At Tewkesbury, upon a muddy field
Where all their dreams of victory are repealed
I see the brothers of the House of York
Surround the prince and do their bloody work

I watch the boy, the Lancastrian, sweet Ned
Join the great legions of the noble dead
I hear his mother's soul-destroying sound
As the last of her bloodline sinks into the ground

[Chorus]
I was the Cedar, whose arms gave the shade
I was the Kingmaker, the last of my trade
My sword have carved the fate of England's crown
That's the end, I have burned this kingdom down!

[Outro]
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And, live we how we can, yet die we must...
