[Chorus]
If Lancaster's king had his queen on the throne
We would raise our steel with a battle groan
For the Red Rose queen who is fighting alone
In this war of thorns, you don't bleed on your own

[Verse 1]
My Henry is frail and his mind is gone (gone, gone, gone)
The White Rose of York thinks the war can be won
But I feel the fire as their armies take
The crown that is my son's by right, for God's sake!

[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need you to save me
They call me she-wolf of France, you can't tame me
And you might see a woman, not a sword
But my sacred claim comes down from the Lord!

[Chorus]
If Lancaster's king had his queen on the throne
We would raise our steel with a battle groan
For the Red Rose queen who is fighting alone
In this war of thorns, you don't bleed on your own

[Verse 2]
So you dare to defy me? Then traitor, your head!
My banner of crimson will leave your fields red
This kingdom I'll purchase with sorrow and cost
You'll learn the true price of the birthright you've lost!

[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need you to save me
They call me she-wolf of France, you can't tame me
My resolve is the one thing they can't break
I am stronger now for my dynasty's sake!

[Chorus]
If Lancaster's king had his queen on the throne
We would raise our steel with a battle groan
For the Red Rose queen who is fighting alone
In this war of thorns, you don't bleed on your own

[Bridge]
On England's board, a king moves one square at a time
But I, the Queen, unleash my host and claim what's mine
You get too close, you'll face a bloody, royal high
Now witness my ascension to the sky!

[Chorus]
If Lancaster's king had his queen on the throne
We would raise our steel with a battle groan
For the Red Rose queen who is fighting alone
In this war of thorns, you don't bleed on your own!
