Under Charles VII, the French developed a superior artillery corps, driven by innovations in cannon design, gunpowder quality, and casting techniques. Lighter and more mobile cannons allowed for quicker deployment. The use of iron cannonballs proved devastating against stone walls. These developments, guided by figures like Jean Bureau, revolutionized siege warfare.",
